# 🤖 Leveraging Monocular Depth Estimation for the rapid 3D Digitization of Cultural Heritage Artefacts 🤖 

## Project Overview

The present project provides a full pipeline for the production of 3D models of coin-like objects, starting from a single image as input.

It is being developed as part of an ongoing Master Thesis on: 
<p align="center">
  <b> Utilizing Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) Models for the Digitization of Cultural Heritage Objects.<br>
  <i>Leveraging deep learning-based MDE for the rapid production of 3D models of archaeological artefacts that carry micro-reliefs.</i> </b>
</p>

Carried out as part of the M.A. Program on <i> <a href="https://dca.uni-koeln.de/">Digital and Computational Archaeology </a></i> at the Universität zu Köln.

Student: Konstantina Eleftheriadi <br>
Supervisor: Prof. Dr. Eleftheria Paliou <br>

## 💻 Full 2D-to-3D Pipeline

The full 2D-to-3D pipeline can be ran locally, by cloning the repository to a local device. <br>
<p align="center"> 
  ❗ Deprecated libraries may cause conflicts with updated versions of Python. <br>
It is recommended that you run the code in a <i>virtual environment</i> running 
  <b> <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31210/">Python v.3.12.10</a>
  </b> ❗ 
</p>

👉 For quicker deployment, a

has also been created. 
Please follow the instructions carefully. <br> <br>
TBD: 
- [ ] Create instructional video
